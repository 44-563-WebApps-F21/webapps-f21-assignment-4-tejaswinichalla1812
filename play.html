    <p class="stage-direction">[LORD ILLINGWORTH_and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
    sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]</p>
    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> 
    <p class="speech">But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_ILLINGWORTH">LORDILLINGWORTH.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.</p>

    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_ILLINGWORTH">LORDILLINGWORTH.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">So Lady Hunstanton told me.</p>

    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
    I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_ILLINGWORTH">LORDILLINGWORTH.</h6>  
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Winces slightly_.]</p>  
    <p class="speech">Really?</p>  
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Goes over and puts his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]</p>  
    <p class="speech">You have missed not having a father, I suppose, Gerald?</p>

    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such
    a mother as I have had.</p>

    <h6 class="name LORD_ILLINGWORTH">LORDILLINGWORTH.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that
    most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,
    that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
    After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
    a hole as Wrockley, could you?</p>

    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!</p>
