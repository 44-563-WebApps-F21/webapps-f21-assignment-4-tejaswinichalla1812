<h3>A Woman of No Importance A Play</h3>
<h4>The Hall at Hunstanton Chase</h4>
<pre>
    [LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
    sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]
    GERALD.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.

    GERALD.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.

    GERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
    I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts
    his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,
    I suppose, Gerald?

    GERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such
    a mother as I have had.

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that
    most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,
    that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
    After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
    a hole as Wrockley, could you?

    GERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!
