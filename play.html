<h3>A Woman of No Importance A Play</h3>
<h4>The Hall at Hunstanton Chase</h4>
<pre>
    <p>[LORD ILLINGWORTH_and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
    sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]</p>
    <h6>GERALD.</h6> 
    <p>But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p>

    <h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  
    <p>I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.</p>

    <h6>GERALD.</h6>  
    <p>I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.</p>

    <h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  
    <p>So Lady Hunstanton told me.</p>

    <h6>GERALD.</h6>  
    <p>It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
    I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.</p>

    <h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  
    <p>[_Winces slightly_.]</p>  
    <p>Really?</p>  
    <p>[_Goes over and puts his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]</p>  
    <p>You have missed not having a father, I suppose, Gerald?</p>

    <h6>GERALD.</h6>  
    <p>Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such
    a mother as I have had.</p>

    <h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  
    <p>I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that
    most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,
    that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
    After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
    a hole as Wrockley, could you?</p>

    <h6>GERALD.</h6>  
    <p>Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!</p>
